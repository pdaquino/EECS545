Strategies
1.) Run Away
	-Move in a straight direction (determine angle and velocity)

2.) Stand Stil 
	-Continue in current direction and stop motors (determine when to halt)

3.) Turning Move
	-Move in turning direction (determine angular velocity and forward velocity)

4.) Wave Surfing
	-More research needed on this technique

5.) Feigning 
	-Move in a direction, then reverse movement (determine direction, velocity, when to reverse)

6.) Serpentine 
	-Move in a serpentine manner (determine end location, angle of serpentine, speed, rate of change)

7.) Random 
	-Random movement (determine how often to change go-to location)
